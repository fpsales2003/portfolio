This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# description
This is a portfolio website containing all of my projects. I am continuously updating and changing this site as I learn and grow as a developer, so feel free to check back frequently (it may be completely different).
This project is built using React and Next.js. In it, I am utilizing framer-motion to handle all of the transitions and animations, as well as Tailwind.css for styling.
